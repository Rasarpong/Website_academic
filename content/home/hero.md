## **About Me** 
 My name is Kenneth Annan, and I am a PhD candidate in the Applied Economics program at Oregon State University (OSU). Prior to starting my PhD at OSU, I received a double Msc. degree in Economics and Data Science from South Dakota State University (SDSU). I am originally from Ghana, where I received a Bsc. in Mathematics with Economics at the University of Cape Coast (UCC).


My primary research focuses on agricultural economics, as well as  environmental and resource economics. I study  topics related to irrigation and water rights, wildfires, land use and land values, import demand, cropping pattern changes, and commodity price analysis.

I also conduct research in development economics and international trade and employ a range of applied econometric techniques to conduct in-depth analyses. My research aims to provide valuable insights that inform policymakers on critical agricultural, resource, and environmental policies. 
### Research interests:
- Regional Economics
- Rural Development
- Environmental Economics
- Causal Machine Learning
