I am PhD Candidate in Applied Economics, with a specialization in Regional and Environmental Economics. 
My research focuses on how place-based policies and environmental factors influence business decisions within spatial and geographic contexts. I am particularly interested in investigating the mechanisms through which place-based policies, such as minimum wage laws, and environmental policies or events shape the spatial distribution of economic activities

In my current research, I explore how economic policies and environmental conditions affect firm behavior, investment decisions, and regional economic resilience. My current work explores the impact of Oregonâ€™s three-tier minimum wage system on the rural-urban development divide, with a focus on firm survival and economic stability. This research aims to provide insights into how differentiated wage policies in distinct geographic regions can either mitigate or exacerbate economic disparities.
